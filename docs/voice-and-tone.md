### **Voice** reflects the personality of a brand through words – how it acts, what it believes in, and its point of view. A good brand voice is familiar, predictable and identifiable. It reinforces the type of person the brand would be.

Our voice is friendly, reliable, direct and inspirational. We are passionate about democratizing access to geospatial data and empowering developers to scale up their products – our voice reflects that.

We can relate to the needs of our audience.

We are fluent in technical language, but only use it when necessary.

We are impactful and speak directly and confidently.

We remain both precise and concise.

**Professional** but **friendly**<br>
**Technical** but **relatable**<br>
**Impactful** but **simple**<br>
**Cheerful**, **fast** but...

**Confident** but not **overbearing**<br>
**Direct** but not **pushy**<br>
**Reliable** but not **dull**

### **Tone** is the way a brand uses its voice in different situations. It changes frequently to stay empathetic and relevant. Think about the way you would talk to a group of adults, versus a group of children. It is the same you, but your tone will be different.

To make the most of every interaction, we dial specific tonal traits up or down depending on the type of person we are talking to.
