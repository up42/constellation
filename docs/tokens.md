### Design tokens are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) describes them. They are used to ensure a better consistency across any platform.

The tokens are provided through [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo), which takes care of converting the base definition of the tokens we have into something usable by our applications. Theo allows us to organise our tokens into specific [categories](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo#supported-categories), and allow special transformations by marking the tokens with a special `type` (e.g. `color`, `number`, ...).
